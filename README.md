# ðŸŒ¿ Renewable Energy Analysis

This project explores global renewable energy generation trends across 100+ countries using Python. It aims to uncover regional disparities, long-term adoption patterns across solar, wind, and hydro sources, and identify growth opportunities for sustainable development.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

- Several European countries, including Iceland and Norway, surpassed **90% renewable electricity share** by 2020.
- **Hydropower** dominates the renewable energy mix globally, especially in Latin America and parts of Asia.
- Countries with rising solar and wind investments are steadily closing the energy gap.
- **Time-series visualizations** and comparative heatmaps highlight regional adoption patterns and progress.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** â€“ Data cleaning and aggregation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** â€“ Visualization and analytics  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Exploratory data analysis
